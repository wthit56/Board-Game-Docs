			<p>This legend takes place on the back side of the game 
			board. First, follow the steps on the <strong>Standard Setup 
			Instructions</strong> card. Then, place the following materials 
			near the game board: The 3 Varkur&rsquo;s Hideout 
			legend cards, the 2 Mine Instructions legend cards, 
			the witch marker, the Shield Dwarves marker, the 
			troll markers, the wardrak markers, the N tile, the 
			poison token, and 3 black dice.</p>

			<p>Gather the following tokens facedown and individually 
			mix each group: 8 boulder tokens, 11 gems, 3 medicinal 
			herbs, 6 rune stones, and 6 parchments. Then, 
			gather 15 monster tiles and return the tiles &ldquo;Place 1 
			gor in space 21. Place 1 troll in space 23&rdquo; and &ldquo;Place 
			1 skral in space 48. Place 2 gold in space 50&rdquo; to the 
			game box. Mix the remaining monster tiles facedown.</p>

			<p>Then, set the following additional materials next to 
			the game board:</p>

			<p>Place the <strong>N tile</strong> with the green side up in space N of 
			the legend track. Place <strong>1 star token</strong> each in spaces 
			B and F. Place <strong>1 gem token</strong> in each space with 
			a blue gem icon, excluding spaces 0, 2, 3, and 4. 
			Return the four remaining gem tokens to the game 
			box without revealing them. Place <strong>1 helm</strong>, <strong>1 shield</strong>, 
			<strong>1 bow</strong>, and <strong>1 wineskin</strong> in space <strong>27</strong>. Place <strong>2 boulder 
			tokens</strong> faceup in space <strong>21</strong>.</p>

			<p>Separate the following cards and individually 
			shuffle each deck: 11 silver event cards (replacing 
			the golden event cards) and 10 secret lake cards.</p>

			<p>Determine the location of <strong>5 of the 6 rune stones</strong> 
			and <strong>2 of the 3 medicinal herbs</strong> by generating a 
			two-digit number (as explained on the Rune Stones 
			legend card).</p>

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not remember the rules introduced 
			in Legend 4 explaining gem tokens, firestorms, 
			boulder tokens, or the secret lake, refer to the 2 
			Mine Instructions legend cards. Otherwise, these 
			cards are not required.</p>

			<p>Place <strong>1 gor each</strong> in spaces <strong>15</strong> and <strong>34</strong>.</p>

			<p class="story">
				Few know that before the heroes fought the dragon 
				Tarok, they encountered the dark mage Varkur 
				once more. He had fled into the mine of the shield 
				dwarves, where he studied the ancient magical arts. 
				The heroes sought to rid the mine of his shadow, but 
				the skrals joined themselves with Varkur, secluding 
				him deep in the perilous caverns. Now the heroes 
				must find these skrals so that the monsters may lead 
				them to the dark mage&rsquo;s hiding place.
			</p>
			
			<p>Skrals are placed on the game board when the 
			heroes reveal and resolve monster tiles. When the 
			third skral is placed on the game board, roll 1 hero 
			die and read the Varkur&rsquo;s Hideout legend card with 
			the dice icon that matches the die result.</p>

			<div class="legend objective">
				<p>The party wins the legend if they defeat 3 skrals and the dark mage.</p>

				<p>Place <strong>2 monster tiles</strong> facedown in spaces <strong>10</strong>, <strong>28</strong>, <strong>35</strong>, and <strong>43</strong>.</p>

				<p>When a hero enters one of these spaces, he must 
				end his move action. Then, he immediately reveals 
				and resolves both tiles, beginning with the top tile.</p>

				<p>Place <strong>3 monster tiles</strong> facedown and <strong>1 troll</strong> in space 
				<strong>6</strong>. Heroes cannot resolve these 3 monster tiles until 
				they defeat the troll.</p>

				<p><strong>Note:</strong> Heroes may use the telescope to reveal 
				monster tiles in adjacent spaces without resolving 
				the monster tiles, including the monster tiles 
				guarded by the troll. Monster tiles revealed in this 
				way remain faceup on the board, stacked in their 
				original order.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Place the Shield Dwarves marker in space <strong>40</strong>. 
			Shield Dwarves follow the standard rules for allies.</p>

			<p>Each time a monster enters space <strong>0</strong> (the southern 
			mine), move the N tile 1 space on the legend track 
			closer to space A. Then, immediately return that 
			monster to the game box.</p>

			<p><strong>Important:</strong> If a skral enters space <strong>0</strong>, the party immediately 
			loses the legend.</p>

			<p>In this legend, a hero whose willpower falls to &ldquo;0&rdquo; is 
			returned to the game box. He places his gems, gold, 
			and items in the space he last occupied.</p>

			<p>Place all heroes in space <strong>60</strong>. Each hero starts with 
			<strong>2 strength points</strong>. The party <strong>receives 5 gold, and 2 
			damaged shields</strong>.</p>

			<p class="story">
				One of the heroes stares into the dark entrance of 
				the mine. &ldquo;The sooner we know where Varkur is 
				hidden, the better,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hunt some 
				skral!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<h2>Mine Instructions</h2>
			<h3>Firestorms</h3>
			<p>To resolve a firestorm, a hero rolls 3 red dice in succession 
			and places the first die in the frame near space 10, 
			the second die in the frame near space 20, and the third 
			die in the frame near space 30.</p>

			<p>Each firestorm begins in the space that corresponds to 
			the frame (10, 20, or 30) and extends a number of spaces 
			equal to the die result in the direction of the arrows. If 
			a hero occupies one of those spaces, he loses willpower 
			points equal to the die result.</p>

			<strong>Remember:</strong> If a hero is reduced to &ldquo;0&rdquo; willpower points, 
			return him to the game box.</p>

			<p>A hero may use a shield to prevent the effects of a firestorm. 
			Monsters are not affected by a firestorm. Boulders 
			block all firestorms. A firestorm occurs each time a hero 
			collects a gem and at the start of each new day (as indicated 
			by the fire symbol on the sunrise box).</p>

			<h3>Shield Dwarves</h3>

			<p>The Shield Dwarves follow the standard rules for allies 
			described in the Reference Booklet. They cannot reveal 
			or collect any tokens, and they cannot reveal or resolve 
			monster tiles. They cannot end their movement in space 
			11 (the secret lake), and they do not cause secret lake 
			event cards to be drawn. They cannot enter or move 
			through spaces containing boulder tokens, but if they 
			are adjacent to the boulders, they add 4 to the final battle 
			value against the boulders.</p>

			<h3>Boulders</h3>

			<p>Boulders block the way. Heroes and monsters cannot enter 
			a space containing a boulder token, and the falcon cannot 
			fly through spaces containing a boulder token. To remove 
			one or more boulder tokens from an adjacent space, a hero 
			performs a fight action against the boulders. Treat this as a 
			standard battle (i.e., use items, invite other heroes to a team 
			battle, etc.), except that the boulders do not roll dice, and 
			heroes do not lose willpower if they lose the round of battle.</p>

			<p>If the hero&rsquo;s battle value is greater than the value on one 
			of the boulder tokens, he may return that boulder token 
			to the game box. If the hero&rsquo;s battle value is greater than 
			the sum of two or more boulder tokens, he may return 
			those boulder tokens to the game box.</p>

			<h3>Gems</h3>

			<p>Heroes can collect gems in the mine, and they carry collected 
			gems in the coin purse on their hero boards. The number 
			on a gem token indicates that gem&rsquo;s value in gold (2, 4, or 
			6). Revealing a gem with a telescope poses no threat to the 
			heroes, but collecting a gem causes a firestorm to occur.</p>

			<p>If a monster enters a space with a gem, immediately return 
			that gem to the game box. Unlike in Legend 5, gems 
			do not change the direction in which monsters move.</p>

			<h3>The Secret Lake</h3>

			<p>Each time a hero enters space 11 (the secret lake), he 
			immediately ends his movement, draws the top card from 
			the secret lake deck, and reads it aloud.</p>

						Please assist us in our hour of need.&rdquo;
					</p>
	
					<p>Place <strong>1 parchment token</strong> facedown in space <strong>63</strong>. The 
					first time a monster enters this space, reveal the parchment 
					token. Each hero who has willpower points 
					<strong>greater than</strong> the number on the parchment token 
					must reduce his willpower points to the revealed number. 
					Then, return the Shield Dwarves to the game box.</p>

					<p>Determine the location of the poison token by 
					generating a two-digit number (as explained on the 
					Rune Stones legend card).</p>
	
					<p>A hero uses the poison in a battle after the hero 
					strikes, but before the monster strikes. If the hero 
					wins the round of battle in which the poison was 
					used, he immediately defeats the monster. A monster 
					defeated in this way yields no rewards. Do not 
					place this monster on space 80, but instead return it 
					to the game box. Do not advance the legend marker 
					along the legend track. Much like a wineskin or 
					witch&rsquo;s brew, a hero may use the poison twice.</p>
	
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> A hero cannot use the poison in battle against 
					the dark mage.</p>

					<p>Randomly determine the location of <strong>6 boulder tokens</strong>. 
					To do this, roll 1 red die and 1 black die, then add the 
					results together. Place 1 random boulder token in the 
					space that matches the sum of the dice results. Repeat this 
					process for each boulder token. For example, if the black 
					die produces a result of &ldquo;12&rdquo; and the red die produces a 
					result of &ldquo;5,&rdquo; place 1 boulder token in space 17. Reveal 
					each boulder token immediately after placing it.</p>
	
					<p>If a boulder token is placed in a space containing a 
					marker, follow the steps below:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>If a monster (including skrals) is in that space, return 
					it to the game box. The heroes do not receive a 
					reward, and the legend marker does not advance on 
					the legend track. </li>
						<li>If a one or more heroes are in that space, each hero 
					in that space loses willpower points equal to the 
					boulder token&rsquo;s value. Then, return the boulder 
					token to the game box.</li>
						<li>If the Shield Dwarves or the dark mage are in that 
					space, return the boulder token to the game box.</li>
					</ol>
	
					<p>If a monster enters a space containing a boulder token, 
					the monster continues moving to the next adjacent space, 
					following the direction of the arrow.</p>
