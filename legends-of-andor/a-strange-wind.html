				<p>The Queen and Prince Thorald have declared a time of celebration; great levity can be found throughout the whole of the kingdom. The masses were saved from the terror of the Mighty Dragon and the kingdom was again at peace and free from the plottings of the Dark Mage Varkur. The Heroes were enjoying some well-deserved time off at the local tavern, as the Prince himself led them in drinking games and endless rounds of songs.</p>
				<p>It was barely dawn and the sun was just about to peak over the horizon, the heroes were just waking from their drunken slumbers and approaching the innkeeper to order their first round of the day when an unnatural wind threw open the door and pushed through the inn, sending a chill down the spine of everyone inside. When it finally died down, the heroes swore they could hear a voice calling to them, saying &ldquo;Darkness is alive, inside...&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Just as the heroes were going to comment about the strangely familiar disembodied voice, a young man came running through the doorway. &ldquo;Heroes come quickly! There is a battlement forming at the tree of songs!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That wind was trying to tell us something..&rdquo; said the first hero pensively.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous,&rdquo; said the other &ldquo;The air cannot speak, come! To the forest, and to Glory!&rdquo;</p>
			</div>
			<p>Follow the standard setup instructions. Place a star token on space B and E of the legend track. Determine the locations of <strong>5 rune stones</strong> and <strong>2 medicinal herbs.</strong> Roll a die to place <strong>5 monster tiles</strong> on the legend track. If the witch token is discovered the heroes receive one free bottle of brew as usual, but are unable to purchase any more; do not place the witch figure in the space, but instead mark the space with a star token. It is assumed that she isn&rsquo;t home and the heroes just find a bottle laying about.</p>
			<p>Place the tower piece and a <strong>skrall</strong> on space 60. Then place a <strong>Gor</strong> on spaces 59 and 58 (do not move at sunrise)</p>
			<p>Place your heroes on space 72 with Prince Thorald.</p>
			<p>Reveal <strong>3 random monster tiles</strong> and place them accordingly.</p>
			<div class="legend objective">
				<p>The heroes must defeat the Skrall general and his minions (in spaces 58, 59 and 60) before the legend marker reaches <strong>N</strong> on the legend track or the heroes fail the legend.</p>
				<p>The Skrall General has a very good vantage point; the Skrall&rsquo;s strength is 6 for each hero.</p>

					<p>The heroes again revel in their amazing battle prowess and joy in their accomplishments. Just as they take a long sigh of relief the same cold wind as before rushes over the hillside and sinks into their bones. On the wind, the same familiar voice can be heard, whispering &ldquo;Darkness is alive, inside&hellip;&rdquo; The heroes shake themselves.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;That voice...it&rsquo;s so familiar, who could it be?&rdquo; a hero wonders aloud.</p>
					<p>A smile creeps onto the other heroes face &ldquo;Aye, let&rsquo;s see, who do we know that deals in all things creepy and magical, and is obsessed with darkness? It&rsquo;s Varkur! The bloody Dark Mage is back!&rdquo; he shouts, and draws his weapon, ready to attack the wind.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo;the other hero whispers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a threat I think it&rsquo;s a warning. But who would warn us about dark magic?&rdquo; The hero doesn&rsquo;t finish, understanding floods through him, and without a word, he begins to run toward the west.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?!&rdquo; the other hero shouts.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he beckons. &ldquo;We have to find the Witch!&rdquo;</p>

					<p>The heroes again revel in their amazing battle prowess and joy in their accomplishments. Just as they are climbing down from the tower, a soldier appears and tells them that he has been to the farm and found the farmer and his family dead.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div data-requirements="witch">
					<div class="story">
						<p>When the heroes reach the witches home, they find it in shambles. They make their way through the small cottage and find furniture overturned and countless bodies of soldiers again bearing the sigil of Reitburg Castle guards.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;There was a fight here,&rdquo; one hero said. &ldquo;But what are the guards doing so far from the castle?&rdquo;</p>
						<p>They followed the signs of struggle to the surrounding woods, scorch marks tore into the trees and bodies littered the ground; the smell of burnt wood and flesh hung thickly in the air. The battle seemed to have culminated at a ring of charred earth and timber that formed a circle; five strides wide, around a single body. As they moved closer they recognize it as the prince.</p>
						<p>Moving him onto his back, the heroes discover that he is still breathing. He opens his eyes slowly, and looks up at them.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;...too late,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;...too late,&rdquo; the prince moans again before falling unconscious.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;First the wind speaks, then the Gor organize themselves, Castle guards are killed by other soldiers in the borderlands, now this?!&rdquo; a hero exclaims.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says another, &ldquo;something is definitely amiss in the castle.&rdquo; The hero pulls out the letter they had been carrying. &ldquo;I think it might be time to read this.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Are you mad?!&rdquo; replies the other. &ldquo;Only royalty can break a royal seal?! Or it&rsquo;s treason!&rdquo;</p>
						<p>&ldquo;I guess we have to find a royal, then&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
					</div>
					<p>Place the Prince Thorald marker on its side in the location of the Witch fog token. While the prince is wounded, the heroes do not receive a bonus to their attack.</p>
					<p>The heroes must decide if they want to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Take the letter and wounded prince to the queen. All heroes and the prince must venture to the Reitburg Castle (space 0). The prince can only move 2 spaces at a time instead of 4 as he is wounded, and he does not give any bonus while in combat.
						</li>
						<li>
							Or wait here for an entire day for the prince to recover and read the letter.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<div data-requirements="letter == 'castle'">
					<div class="story">
						<p>The heroes are greeted as they enter the castle grounds and are escorted to the Queen. Upon entering the ornately decorated throne room, the Queen is shocked to see the prince is alive and gives orders for him to be taken to his chambers and heavily guarded.</p>
						<p>The heroes give her the letter they found.(Remove scroll from inventory and return it to the game box)</p>
						<p>The Queen opens the letter and sighs audibly. The heroes look at each other in confusion. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, your majesty?&rdquo; one hero asks.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;It appears that our plea for help didn&rsquo;t make it,&rdquo; she says.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;A plea for help? To whom? Is this about the voice we&rsquo;ve been hearing?&rdquo; they ask.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;It is, but I doubt you will hear it any longer. It appears that the prince has been in league with the Dark Mage Varkur, as his apprentice. He has been using his new powers to alter the mind of the witch Reka to doing his bidding.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>The heroes gasp in surprise. &ldquo;But her warning?&rdquo;</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Yes, Reka is very strong&rdquo; the Queen continued, &ldquo;She was able to fight against the prince&rsquo;s powers to try and warn you about him.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Darkness is alive, inside&hellip;&rdquo; a hero whispers. &ldquo;She meant inside the castle?&rdquo;</p>
						<p>The Queen nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. We were writing to the keepers of the Tree of Songs to see if they could use their healing magic to help her, but the prince&rsquo;s spies must have found our messenger.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>The doors to the throne room burst open and a frantic soldier runs up to the queen, falling to his knees. &ldquo;Your majesty! The prince has died from his wounds and the witch is gone!&rdquo;</p>
						<p>The building rumbles as a scream rings through the castle and echoes off the stone walls.</p>
						<p>A hero drew his weapon, &ldquo;You have the witch here?!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Queen exclaimed worriedly, &ldquo;I heard her warning, too and sent a regiment of my personal guards to escort her here so she wouldn&rsquo;t have to hide in the woods any longer. They told me that the prince fought them but was eventually killed, so they brought her here until she was well again.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>Screams shook the building so violently that the glass windows behind the throne shattered.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;But if he is dead, then why is Reka doing this?!&rdquo; A hero exclaimed.</p>
						<p>A bolt of lightning shot through the broken windows and into the throne room, sending the heroes and the Queen flying in all directions. As the heroes looked to the center of the room, where the bolt had hit, they saw the witch, she was bathed in purple shadow; her eyes glowing with a fiendish blue hue. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she shouted &ldquo;I, Thorald, have taken over the witch&rsquo;s mind completely, and now, the kingdom will be mine!&rdquo;</p>
					</div>
					<p>Place the witch figure in the castle (space 0).</p>

						<p>After a night of fevered dreams and a full day of care, the prince finally awakens, rested and fully recovered. &ldquo;What...what happened?&rdquo; he asks.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we would like to know,&rdquo; replies one of the heroes, handing the prince the letter they found at the farm.
					</div>
					<p>Prince Thorald, being healed, now stands up and moves normally. Remove the scroll from your inventory and return it to the game box.</p>
					<div class="story">
						<p>The prince opens the letter and reads it with a sorrowful expression. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as we feared, then,&rdquo;</p>
						<p>the prince says.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; a hero asks. &ldquo;Is is about the voice that we&rsquo;ve been hearing?&rdquo;</p>
						<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; the prince replies, sighing heavily &ldquo;though I doubt you will hear it any longer. It appears that the Queen has been in league with the Dark Mage Varkur, for a long time and has been using her new powers to alter the mind of the witch Reka to do his bidding.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>&ldquo;Yes, Reka is very strong&rdquo; the prince continued, &ldquo;She was able to fight against the Queen&rsquo;s powers to try and warn you about her.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Darkness is alive, inside&hellip;&rdquo; a hero whispered. &ldquo;She meant inside the castle?&rdquo;</p>
						<p>The Prince nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. When I heard her scream I knew that they had found her in the woods, where she was hiding, so I came as fast as I could to try and help her. But the Queen was already here with a host of men loyal to her. There were too many, and...and I was too late.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; a hero asked, &ldquo;you mean, the witch she&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
						<p>The prince shook his head, &ldquo;Not dead, but as good as... The Queen decided that since she couldn&rsquo;t control her, she would absorb her power. The surge from the spell caused a massive explosion and I was knocked out. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else survived.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; one hero said happily &ldquo;maybe the Queen died too, problem solved.&rdquo;</p>
						<p>A long shriek was heard in the distance.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Somehow, I doubt it,&rdquo; the prince muttered.</p>
						<p>The sound grew closer, and echoed through the valley. It was a roar that bellowed deep into the earth followed by a shrill tone that shook your very mind.</p>
						<p>It was a sound that was all too familiar to the heroes.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&hellip;&rdquo; a hero whispered. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t, could she?! It&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p>
						<p>A dark figure flew over them and toward the eastern edge of the forest.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s turned herself into a dragon?!&rdquo; a hero shouted.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; yelled the prince, &ldquo; and she is heading for the Tree of Songs, with Reka gone, it&rsquo;s the only place left in the kingdom with enough magic to stop her, hurry! There is not a moment to waste!&rdquo;</p>
